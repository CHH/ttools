ttools dev
======

TTools (Twitter Tools) Library is currently under development. It aims to make life easier for twitter app developers, providing a simple workflow for authentication, while maintaining a high-level of flexibility for various types of applications.

If you are a php developer and want to help, you are welcome. 

requirements and install
=====

TTools relies (for now) on a forked version of themattharris/tmhOAuth.
Add this to your composer.json:

<pre>
{
    "repositories": [{
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/erikaheidi/tmhOAuth.git"
    }],
    "require": {
            "ttools/ttools": "dev-master",
        "tmhoauth/tmhoauth": "dev-ttools"
    }
}

</pre>

After running composer install, you will have a "vendor" folder with both libraries. Just add the autoload.php generated by composer and you can call TTools in your project.

See the demos for usage examples.
